I'm thankful that the instructor took the time to create this course which is full of hands on examples that you can retake as many times as you need in order to drill the concepts home.

I personally enjoyed this course a lot and I can apply all the knowledge I learned from it in my workplace on a daily basis. Regarding the language and accent, if the trainee has lived his entire life with one single accent around him in a small town, this course might be a bit challenging to follow, but if one is coming with an international mind-set, he can follow every single line of the course. The only negative comment could be that the course pace might be very fast for new learners and before each session, a bit of definitions, terminology and concepts could be helpful. the course starts with a list of tasks and then goes right away to terminal and commands. Good for me, but for new people in Cisco world, it might be a bit challenging to follow.
